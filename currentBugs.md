# Current bugs after BPMN.js --> Diagram.js

- replay does not work
- context pad size changed
- copyPaste does not work
- snapping to shape middle when connecting does not work

### We have not checked for bugs yet

- lasso tool/space tool functionality ?
- shortcuts

### We had bugs but cant reproduce them

- labels are correctly updated in dst, but the displayed version does not get renewed, so it looks like it did not work
